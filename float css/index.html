        <div class="sidebar">The addition of Judge Barrett to the court will give conservatives six of the court’s nine
            seats, which Democrats have made a focus of the campaign this fall after the death of Justice Ruth Bader
            Ginsburg. They say it threatens women’s reproductive rights and protections for millions of Americans under
            the Affordable Care Act.

            It also immediately calls into question whether Judge Barrett would recuse herself from ruling on lawsuits
            over the election, a scenario that has seemingly become more likely each time Mr. Trump has tried to cast
            aspersions about the integrity of voting.

            “We’ve made an important contribution to the future of this country,” Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of
            Kentucky and the majority leader, said in a speech just after the filibuster vote on Sunday. “A lot of what
            we’ve done over the last four years will be undone sooner or later by the next election. They won’t be able
            to do much about this for a long time to come.”</div>
